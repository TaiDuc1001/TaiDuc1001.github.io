Our paper titled `"DAAL: Dual Ambiguity in Active Learning for Object Detection with YOLOE"` has been accepted for presentation at <a href='https://conferences.sigappfr.org/medes2025/'>The 17th International Conference on Management of Digital Ecosystems</a>. A new approach to enhance labeling efficiency in object detection by holistically capturing both epistemic and aleatoric uncertainties. DAAL computes a weighted score integrating both and selects the most informative images for annotation, leveraging YOLOE.
