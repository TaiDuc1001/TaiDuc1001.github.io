  ABSTRACT={In many industrialized countries, implementing an efficient face attendance checking system is crucial for effective staff management. The face attendance system nowadays encounters such problems. The biggest challenge to be concerned with is the various light and angle conditions, which can damage the performance of these systems. In this paper, we present an innovative approach that combines the results of GoogLeNet, VGGFace, and FaceNet to achieve higher accuracy through Ensemble Learning. With this solution, newer systems can achieve better results. Our system encompasses image capture, face detection, database management, and feature extraction for face recognition.
