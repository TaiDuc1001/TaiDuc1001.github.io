    ABSTRACT={In many industrialized countries, implementing an efficient face attendance checking system is crucial for effective staff management. The face attendance system nowadays encounters such problems. The biggest challenge to be concerned with is the various light and angle conditions, which can damage the performance of these systems. In this paper, we present an innovative approach that combines the results of GoogLeNet, VGGFace, and FaceNet to achieve higher accuracy through Ensemble Learning. With this solution, newer systems can achieve better results. Our system encompasses image capture, face detection, database management, and feature extraction for face recognition.

    ABSTRACT={Deep neural networks and data-driven intelligence play a crucial role in advancing automated driving, specifically in recognizing traffic signs. However, the dataset in this field is still limited due to the differences in traffic signs across countries. This issue hinders the utilization of artificial intelligence models in automated driving. On the other hand, creating a traffic sign dataset is costly and time-consuming due to the large number and variations of signs worldwide. To address this problem, researchers have introduced a technique called active learning, which aims to reduce labeling costs in training methods. However, applying active learning to the object detection field is challenging due to the unknown number of traffic signs in a given sample. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end system that combines a pre-trained object detection model as a supervisor with the active learning technique and hybrid labeling to address the need for low-budget datasets. Our method offers an efficient labeling approach that significantly reduces human effort by up to two-thirds of the time. Furthermore, our approach achieves performance comparable to using a dataset fully labeled by humans. The source code is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/TransferAL-8A42},

    ABSTRACT={In recent years, AI development has brought many significant changes in various aspects of our daily lives. Integrating AI technology into various applications has revolutionized multiple domains, and one particularly vital area is traffic sign recognition, which significantly enhances driver safety. This paper presents an approach to traffic sign recognition specifically designed for the Jetson Nano 2GB device. By utilizing the YOLOv8 Nano model, the proposed approach achieves a remarkable frame rate of up to 32 frames per second (FPS). To optimize inference speed on Jetson with limited memory, the approach incorporates TensorRT and quantization techniques. In addition, this paper introduces a dataset called the Vietnamese Traffic Sign Detection Database 100 (VTSDB100). This dataset is an extension of the VTSDB46 dataset and encompasses a comprehensive collection of 100 different classes of traffic signs. These signs were captured in diverse locations within Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, providing a rich and diverse dataset for training and evaluating traffic sign recognition models. An extensive experiment and analysis are also conducted using various object detection methods on the VTSDB100 dataset. The findings highlight the potential of deploying the proposed approach on resource-constrained devices and provide valuable insights for further research and development in the field of AI-powered driver safety systems.}
